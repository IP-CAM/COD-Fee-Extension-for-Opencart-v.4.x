## Installation Instructions

### Important note

OpenCart requires all extension package filenames to end in the `.ocmod.zip` format for successful installation. Although the `ps_cod_fee` extension is not technically an `OCMOD` (since it contains all the required files to work properly without any `OCMOD` modifications), the package still needs to follow this naming convention to ensure compatibility with OpenCart's installer.
